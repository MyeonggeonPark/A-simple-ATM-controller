# A simple ATM controller

I created two card numbers for testing.
    
    > Card-Number: 11111111   
    > Password: '1111'

    > Card-Number: 22222222   
    > Password: '2222'

ATM controller process

    Insert Card number > PIN number(password) > Select Account > See Balance/Deposit/Withdraw


All the code is included in the main.py. I built two classse for the ATM controller.

    class Bank() creates an account.
    class Controller() is used to operate the atm.
    test_bank, test_atm are classes for testing.
